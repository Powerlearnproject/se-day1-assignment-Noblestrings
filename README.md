#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It involves using structured methodologies, programming languages, frameworks, and tools to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions that meet user and business requirements.

Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry includes; Building Reliable and Scalable Software, Cost and Time Efficiency, Security and Risk Mitigation, Enabling Innovation, Industry Growth and Job Opportunities and Interdisciplinary Applications


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering are;
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This was in response to the "Software Crisis," where projects suffered from cost overruns, missed deadlines, and unreliable software.

2. The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)
Before structured programming, software development was often disorganized, relying on "spaghetti code" that was difficult to maintain.

3. The Advent of Agile and DevOps (2000s - Present)
Traditional software development followed the Waterfall model, which was rigid and often led to long development cycles.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are as follows;
1. Requirement Analysis
Gather and document user needs and business requirements.
Define system functionalities and constraints.
Ensure feasibility and align expectations with stakeholders.
2. Planning
Create a roadmap for the project, including budget, timeline, and resource allocation.
Identify risks and define project scope.
Choose the development methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall).
3. Design
Create system architecture, UI/UX design, and database structures.
Define software components, modules, and their interactions.
Establish security, performance, and scalability guidelines.
4. Development (Coding & Implementation)
Convert design specifications into actual code.
Use appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
Perform unit testing to ensure individual components work correctly.
5. Testing
Conduct various tests (unit, integration, system, user acceptance) to identify and fix bugs.
Ensure software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
Validate security, performance, and usability.
6. Deployment
Release the software to users (either all at once or gradually).
Deploy in a production environment.
Ensure proper configuration and integration with existing systems.
7. Maintenance & Support
Monitor software performance and fix bugs.
Provide updates and enhancements based on user feedback.
Ensure security patches and compliance with evolving standards.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
Feature           	Waterfall Methodology	                                                  Agile Methodology
Approach	          Linear and sequential	                                                  Iterative and incremental
Flexibility        	Rigid; changes are difficult to implement	                              Highly flexible; changes are incorporated continuously
Phases            	Fixed, distinct phases(Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment).	Continuous iterations (sprints) involving development, testing, and feedback
Customer Involvement	Limited to the beginning and end of the project	                      Continuous collaboration with stakeholders
Delivery Time       Final product delivered at the end	                                    Working increments delivered regularly
Risk Management	    High risk; issues detected late in development	                        Low risk; early issue detection and adaptation
Documentation	      Extensive documentation required before development starts	            Less emphasis on documentation, more on working software
Best for	          Well-defined, stable projects with clear requirements	                  Dynamic projects with changing requirements and customer feedback

When to Use Waterfall;
Large-scale projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., government contracts, infrastructure software).
Regulated industries where strict documentation and compliance are needed (e.g., healthcare, aerospace).
Projects with clear objectives and no expected requirement changes (e.g., banking software with fixed regulations).
Example:
Developing an air traffic control system where safety regulations and requirements are strictly defined and cannot change during development.

When to Use Agile;
Fast-paced environments where requirements evolve frequently (e.g., startups, mobile app development).
Customer-centric products requiring continuous feedback (e.g., SaaS applications, e-commerce platforms).
Innovative or experimental projects where flexibility is key (e.g., AI-driven software, gaming development).
Example:
Developing a social media application where user feedback is critical, and new features are added iteratively.
Both methodologies have their strengths, and some companies even use hybrid approaches (e.g., Agile-Waterfall mix) to balance structure and flexibility.
